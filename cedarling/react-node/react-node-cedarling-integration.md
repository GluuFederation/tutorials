This guide demonstrates how to build a Node.js application using a new approach to security: Token-Based Access Control, where developers authorize capabilities by presenting a bundle of JWT tokens to a policy engine, specifically the [Janssen Project Cedarling](https://docs.jans.io/head/cedarling/cedarling-overview/). The Cedar policy syntax is very expressive. A developer can even express policies based on a person's role or group membership. And that's exactly what we're going to do here: use TBAC to implement RBAC and ABAC. That may not sound very clear, but please continue for more details on why this makes sense.
