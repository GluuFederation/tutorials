## What is Agama?

Agama is a framework that consists of:

- A DSL (domain-specific language) purposedly designed for writing web flows
- A set of rules that drive the behavior of such flows when they are executed
- The specification of a file format - known as `.gama` - useful for sharing Agama flows. Flows have the `.flow` file extension.

Here, a web flow is understood as a process composed by one or more stages, where at each stage an actor - normally a person - provides some kind of data or response by using a web browser or similar client. Throughout the process only a single actor is involved.
